## Neural Network Approximation Theory

### Introduction
This document delves into the theoretical capabilities of neural networks in approximating mathematical functions. The core idea is to explore whether a neural network can not only replicate a given function but also potentially enhance its performance.

### Definitions
1. **Function \( f \)**: A predefined mathematical function that we aim to approximate.
2. **Function \( g \)**: A hypothetical function that outperforms \( f \) based on a specific performance metric.
3. **Neural Network \( N \)**: A feedforward neural network with parameters \( \theta \) that aims to approximate \( f \).
4. **Performance Metric \( L \)**: A metric (e.g., Mean Squared Error) that measures the difference between the outputs of a function and the true values.

### Assumptions
1. \( N \) perfectly replicates \( f \), i.e., for all inputs \( x \),
   $$ N(x; \theta) = f(x) $$
2. There exists a \( g \) such that for all \( x \),
   $$ L(g, x) < L(f, x) $$

### Objective
To demonstrate that there exists a set of parameters \( \theta' \) for which \( N \) not only approximates \( f \) but also has the potential to approximate \( g \), thereby outperforming \( f \).

### Proof

1. **Neural Network's Approximation Ability**:
   - By the Universal Approximation Theorem, for any continuous function \( g \) and any \( \epsilon > 0 \), there exists a neural network \( N' \) and parameters \( \theta' \) such that:
     $$ |N'(x; \theta') - g(x)| < \epsilon $$
   for all \( x \).

2. **Constructing a Composite Network**:
   - Define a new neural network \( N'' \) as a combination of \( N \) and \( N' \). Specifically, for any input \( x \), the output of \( N'' \) is:
     $$ N''(x; \theta, \theta') = N(x; \theta) + N'(x; \theta') $$

3. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Given the assumption that \( N \) perfectly replicates \( f \), for all \( x \):
     $$ N''(x; \theta, \theta') = f(x) + N'(x; \theta') $$
   - Using the approximation ability of \( N' \), we deduce:
     $$ |f(x) + N'(x; \theta') - g(x)| < \epsilon $$
   This implies that \( N'' \) can potentially approximate \( g \) and thereby outperform \( f \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Through the composite network \( N'' \), constructed from \( N \) and \( N' \), we've demonstrated the potential of neural networks to not only replicate but also enhance the performance of a given function \( f \).
