# Trans4Init: Using Neural Networks to Replace Mathematical Functions in Transformers

## Overview

The `Trans4Init` project aims to explore the potential of replacing traditional mathematical functions in Transformer architectures with trained neural networks. The core idea is to leverage the power of neural networks to not only replicate but potentially enhance the performance of these functions.

## Motivation

While Transformer architectures have revolutionized the field of deep learning, especially in NLP tasks, they rely heavily on predefined mathematical functions, such as the positional embedding. These functions serve as initializations or structural components. But what if we could train neural networks to simulate these functions and potentially offer better performance or flexibility?

## Project Goals

1. **Neural Network Approximation**: Train neural networks to approximate traditional mathematical functions used in Transformers. This will be done one function at a time, ensuring precision and accuracy in replication.
   
2. **Integration into Transformers**: Once a neural network has been trained to approximate a function, integrate it into a Transformer model and assess the performance. 

3. **Iterative Enhancement**: After integration, further train the entire Transformer model, allowing the neural network components to adapt and potentially enhance their performance in the context of the larger model.

## Initial Focus: Positional Embedding

Our first target is the positional embedding function. The traditional positional embedding in Transformers, while effective, is a fixed mathematical formula. We hypothesize that a neural network can be trained to simulate this function and, when integrated into a Transformer, might offer advantages in terms of adaptability and potential performance improvements.
